                <p>
                    Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta
                    accounts for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing
                    cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is
                    produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state of
                    Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.

                <p>
                    Colombia has a reputation as producing mild, well balanced coffee beans.Colombia's average annual
                    coffee production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world, after Brazil and
                    Vietnam; though highest in terms of the arabica
                    bean. The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. Most coffee is
                    grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region.

                <p>
                    Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as
                    Indian monsooned coffee". Its flavor is defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor
                    characteristics of Pacific coffees, but at its worst bland and uninspiring. The two well known
                    species of coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta. Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in
                    India and Southeast Asia is S.795.

                <h2 class="text-center align-baseline">Ethiopia</h2>
                <p>
                    Ethiopian beans can be divided into 3 categories: Longberry, Shortberry, and Mocha. Longberry
                    varieties consist of the largest beans and are often considered of the highest quality in both value
                    and flavor. Shortberry varieties are smaller. The Mocha variety is a highly prized commodity. Mocha
                    Harars are known for their peaberry beans that often have complex chocolate, spice and citrus notes.

                <p>
                    Costa Rican coffee beans are considered among the best in the world. Tarrazu is thought to produce
                    the most desirable coffee beans in Costa Rica. In 2012, Tarrazu Geisha coffee became the most
                    expensive coffee sold by Starbucks in 48 of their stores in the United States, using the Clover
                    automated French press. The finest coffee is typically grown at altitudes of 1200 to 1700 meters.

                <h2 class="text-center align-baseline">Kenya</h2>
                <p>
                    The acidic soil in highlands of central Kenya, just the right amount of sunlight and rainfall
                    provide excellent conditions for growing coffee plants. Coffee from Kenya is of the 'Colombia mild'
                    type, and is well known for its intense flavor, full body, and pleasant aroma with notes of cocoa
                    and high grade coffee from Kenya is one of the most sought-after coffees in the world.
